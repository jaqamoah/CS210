# CS210 Week 7 Project 3 submission



•	The project involved the use of C++ and Python programming languages for developing efficient and secure codes that could be used in Corner Grocer.  The main problems that the project was solving included generating a list of items bought on a specific day along with each item’s purchase frequency, producing a number representing the purchase frequency of specific items on a given day and generating a text-based histogram that lists all items purchased on a day, along with the representation of the purchase frequency of each item . 
•	During the project, I was able to effectively check the syntax of the code. It helped me ensure that the code could run smoothly. 
•	I could have further enhanced the code by applying the latest industry standards and best practices relating to suitable naming conventions as well as in-line comments. 
•	The improvements that could have been introduced by adhering to the latest industry standards relating to appropriate naming conventions and in-line comments could have made the code more efficient, and secure by strengthening the code’s maintainability and readability. 
•	The specific piece of the code that I found the most challenging to write was creating a code to graphically display a data file in the form of a text-based histogram. I was able to overcome the problem by carefully creating the file that contained the right words as well as their frequencies. By integrating all the items that were represented in the form of words, the file aided in writing the specific code. 
•	The skills from this project that would be particularly transferable to other projects or course works include improved comprehension of RDBMS databases like SQL server, better insight into modern software designing, knowledge on the integration of C++ and Python programming languages for developing secure and efficient codes and better problem-solving and analytical skills. 
•	I was able to make this program maintainable, readable, as well as adaptable by complying with the most recent latest industry standards and best practices relating to diverse technical areas. By focusing on the application of relevant naming conventions and in-line comments, the maintainability, readability and adaptability of the program got enhanced. The industry-level standards served as guidelines and helped to write codes by using C++ and Python language effectively. 


As implemented in the Grocery Tracking Program, C++ is effective in building a friendly user interface with possibility of formatting and colors, for example we have used different colors of the background and text for this project making the interface more appealing. Moreover c++ provides more scalability and portability.
On the other hand, C++ has some drawbacks like there is no automatic memory management and it can not effectively handle large amounts of data or data of different types. As we saw during the implementation of the Text-Based Histogram using C++, we had to use two loops, break the string into a substring and convert it from string to int. 
Every language has its strength and weakness like we discussed above, which is the reason when we combine two languages joining their strengths we can have better efficiency and user satisfaction, coming back to our project we saw these benefits in working as we used Python for handling and manipulating data working together with C++ as an external wrapper which provides better user interface. We can create better and more efficient programs by combining more than one programming language, for example if we combine in this project Java which provides automatic memory management and garbage collection as opposed to C++ we could have faster and more efficient code than this one. 
In conclusion, once we are familiar with the strengths of programming languages we should combine them together to make better projects and have more freedom in the functionalities.
